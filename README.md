# Diabetes_Prediction_Using_Machine_Learning

we will be predicting that whether the patient has diabetes or not on the basis of the features we will provide to our machine learning model, and for that, we will be using the famous Pima Indians Diabetes Database.

Data analysis: Here one will get to know about how the data analysis part is done in a data science life cycle.

Exploratory data analysis: EDA is one of the most important steps in the data science project life cycle and here one will need to know that how to make inferences from the visualizations and data analysis

Model building: Here we will be using 4 ML models and then we will choose the best performing model.

Saving model: Saving the best model using pickle to make the prediction from real data.

Conclusion:

After using all these patient records, we are able to build a machine learning model (random forest â€“ best one) to accurately predict whether or not the patients in the dataset have diabetes or not along with that we were able to draw some insights from the data via data analysis and visualization.
